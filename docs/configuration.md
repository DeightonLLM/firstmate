# Configuration

The files and environment variables you set to operate firstmate.

## Orchestrator behavior (AGENTS.md)

The shared orchestrator behavior lives in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) - edit it like any prompt when the fleet is empty, or dispatch shared-repo edits to a crewmate while tasks are in flight.

## Operational home layout and state

This section is the single owner of the top-level operational-home layout; producer script headers and their help own exact child-file fields and mutation contracts.
The tracked code root contains the shared instruction, skill, documentation, workflow, and `bin/` surfaces, while each effective `FM_HOME` contains private operational directories.
`data/` holds durable private fleet records such as the project and secondmate registries, captain preferences, optional shared captain preferences, learnings, backlog, briefs, and scout reports.
`state/` holds volatile runtime records such as task metadata, append-only status events, endpoint signals, watcher and wake-queue coordination, away-mode state, generated X-mode artifacts, private secondmate config-reread generations with their retry and quarantine state, parent-owned secondmate pending-reply records under `state/pending-replies/` (`bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh`), and outbound work-order receipts under `state/outbound-orders/` (`bin/fm-outbound-order.sh`).
`config/` holds local gitignored operating choices, and `projects/` holds the local project clones that Firstmate reads but changes only through the narrow guarded and concrete captain-approved exceptions in `AGENTS.md`.

`bin/fm-spawn.sh` owns the base task-metadata fields it emits, while the runtime-backend section below owns backend-specific fields and selector interpretation.
The producing PR and X helpers own the fields they append, `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns status-event vocabulary, and `bin/fm-crew-state.sh` owns current-state reconciliation.
Wake, watcher, away-mode, and X-specific state mechanics remain with their named scripts and reference sections rather than being duplicated into one exhaustive state tree here.

`bin/fm-session-start.sh`'s header is the single owner of session-start ordering, composed commands, digest contents, and the digest's startup mechanism.
`docs/sessionstart-nudge.md` owns the native session-open adapter mechanics that nudge the digest command.
`AGENTS.md` retains the run-once and read-once operator rules, lock-refusal safety, installation consent, and direct-report recovery boundaries because those facts apply at every session start.
Ordinary dead-direct-report recovery is owned by `stuck-crewmate-recovery`, while persistent-secondmate recovery is owned by `secondmate-provisioning`.

## Pi Calm preference (config/calm)

The Pi Calm extension stores the captain's home-local presentation choice in gitignored `config/calm` under the effective Firstmate home, resolved from `FM_HOME`, then `FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE`, then the home that owns a project-local extension install, then the session's own Firstmate home, then the tracked code root derived from the extension path, or under `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` when that test and specialized-setup override is present. The session-home step applies only when the extension is not installed inside a home, so an account-level install keeps each home's preference separate instead of collapsing every home onto one shared file. A directory is recognised as a Firstmate home by its own `config/`, `data/` and `state/` directories.
The only values it writes are `on` and `off`, each followed by one newline; an absent, unreadable, or unrecognized value defaults to off.
The `/calm` command replaces the file atomically before changing live presentation, so a failed write leaves the current choice unchanged rather than claiming persistence.
The extension reloads this preference on every Pi `session_start`, including startup, new, resume, fork, and reload reasons.
This preference is local to each Firstmate home and is not part of secondmate inherited configuration.

## Backlog backend (.tasks.toml / config/backlog-backend)

The tracked `.tasks.toml` pins the default `tasks-axi` markdown backend to `data/backlog.md`, with `done_keep = 10` and an archive at `data/done-archive.md`.
When the default backend is selected and compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations.
Secondmate handoffs are separate and unconditional: `fm-backlog-handoff.sh` keeps only its own fleet-level validation and always delegates the item move to `tasks-axi mv`, the single owner of the backlog format.
It moves in-scope `## Queued` items only and refuses `## In flight` and historical `## Done` records, which stay with their home for pruning or archiving.
Handoff item bodies must use at least two leading spaces, and the helper refuses a selected item with a single-space or tab-indented continuation rather than risk orphaning it.
Because bootstrap requires `tasks-axi` on `PATH` on every profile, that delegation works fleet-wide, and the `config/backlog-backend=manual` knob governs firstmate's own hand-editing of its backlog, not this validated helper.
Compatible means the shared bootstrap probe accepts `tasks-axi --version` as 0.1.1 or newer, `tasks-axi update --help` exposes `--archive-body`, and `tasks-axi mv --help` exposes `[<id>...]` for the atomic multi-ID move introduced in 0.2.2 and required by handoff delegation.
That sentence is the single owner of the tasks-axi compatibility definition; every other document points here instead of restating the version gates.
Bootstrap requires compatible `tasks-axi` on every profile; see "Toolchain" below for missing-tool reporting and silent default-backend behavior.
Set the local, gitignored `config/backlog-backend` file to `manual` to force manual backlog editing and suppress the verbose `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: tasks-axi available` fact, not missing-tool reporting.
Absent or `tasks-axi` selects the default tasks-axi backend.
The file format is unchanged in both modes; tasks-axi and manual edits produce the same `## In flight`, `## Queued`, and `## Done` sections.

## Runtime backend (config/backend / FM_BACKEND)

For spawn-capable adapters, the runtime session-provider backend controls where task windows/endpoints are created, captured, sent to, watched, and killed.
`tmux` is the verified reference backend (see [`docs/tmux-backend.md`](tmux-backend.md)); `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux` are experimental spawn backends (see [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md), [`docs/zellij-backend.md`](zellij-backend.md), [`docs/orca-backend.md`](orca-backend.md), and [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md)).
Treehouse remains the worktree provider for tmux, herdr, zellij, and cmux, since herdr, zellij, and cmux are session providers only; Orca provides both the task worktree and terminal endpoint.
New spawns choose the backend in this order: an explicit `--backend` flag that current authority for that exact task alone has authorized (a present captain instruction or the task's own accepted brief; never later-task precedent by analogy), then `FM_BACKEND`, then the first non-empty line of local gitignored `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection from `$TMUX`, `HERDR_ENV=1`, or cmux runtime signals, then default `tmux`.
If more than one runtime marker is present, detection resolves innermost-first: `$TMUX` is checked before `HERDR_ENV=1`, which is checked before cmux's primary `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` marker and its documented fallback signals - tmux or herdr started from inside a cmux terminal is the innermost, currently-executing layer, while cmux itself (a terminal application, not a nestable multiplexer) is always checked last.
See [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md#runtime-detection) for why cmux can be selected when `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` is absent.
Auto-detected herdr or cmux prints a stderr notice naming `config/backend` and `--backend tmux` as opt-outs; auto-detected tmux stays silent to preserve existing default behavior.
Zellij and Orca are never auto-detected; select them by putting the name in a local `config/backend` file, by exporting `FM_BACKEND=<name>`, or by telling the first mate in chat.
Any value other than `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux` is rejected until another adapter is implemented and verified.
`fm-spawn.sh` accepts `tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, and `cmux` for ship and scout tasks; `backend=orca` and `backend=cmux` both still refuse `--secondmate` until secondmate launch semantics are designed for each.
`codex-app` is not an accepted runtime backend yet; [`docs/codex-app-backend.md`](codex-app-backend.md) owns the Codex App boundary.
The session-start secondmate liveness sweep uses the recovery-grade `fm_backend_agent_state` classifier where verified.
The comment above that function in `bin/fm-backend.sh` is the single owner of its detailed state contract and recovery authorization.
The compatibility helper `fm_backend_agent_alive` continues to collapse those detailed results to `alive`, `dead`, or `unknown` for older callers.
A herdr spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `herdr` binary's protocol and requires `jq`, refusing loudly on an incompatible or missing installation.
A zellij spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `zellij` binary's version and requires `jq`, refusing loudly when either is missing or the version is older than 0.44.
A cmux spawn additionally version-gates against the installed `cmux` binary's version, requires `jq`, and requires the control socket to be reachable and accessible (see [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md) "Setup" for the one-time socket-access configuration this needs; Automation mode is the recommended socket control mode, with Password mode supported via `config/cmux-socket-password`), refusing loudly and non-retryably on a `cmuxOnly`/unauthenticated socket.
A backend spawn refusal from a missing dependency, version gate, or unauthenticated socket is terminal for that selected backend; firstmate surfaces it as a blocker instead of silently retrying another backend.
Task meta records `backend=` only for a non-default backend; an absent `backend=` means `tmux`, preserving existing default-path meta files.
Every new task records `endpoint_task_id=` as the cleanup binding between the metadata filename and its opaque runtime endpoint.
A herdr task additionally records `herdr_session=`, `herdr_workspace_id=`, `herdr_tab_id=`, and `herdr_pane_id=`.
A zellij task additionally records `zellij_session=`, `zellij_tab_id=`, and `zellij_pane_id=`.
An Orca task additionally records `orca_worktree_id=` and `terminal=`, with `window=fm-<id>` kept as the shared firstmate alias.
A cmux task additionally records `cmux_workspace_id=` and `cmux_surface_id=`.
Task selectors for `fm-peek.sh`, `fm-send.sh`, and `fm-crew-state.sh` resolve centrally through `fm_backend_resolve_selector`.
A selector containing `:` is passed through as an explicit backend endpoint escape hatch.
Otherwise an exact task id matching `state/<id>.meta` wins before the legacy `fm-<id>` label fallback, so task ids that themselves start with `fm-` route to their own metadata instead of being stripped.
A metadata-routed selector returns the recorded backend target (`terminal=` for Orca, otherwise `window=`), and matching explicit targets can still recover the recorded backend when metadata contains the same endpoint.
Only metadata-routed task selectors carry secondmate-marker and Codex-harness context; explicit endpoint escape hatches do not.
These five sentences are the single owner of the task-selector vocabulary; backend guides and other documents point here instead of restating the resolution order.
`fm-teardown.sh <id>` takes a task id directly and validates the complete metadata-only endpoint identity before any runtime dispatch or cleanup mutation.
Missing, empty, duplicate, malformed, backend-inconsistent, or task-mismatched endpoint records are preserved and refused.
Legacy tmux metadata remains cleanup-compatible when its exact window name is `fm-<id>`; opaque non-tmux endpoints require their recorded `endpoint_task_id=` binding.
`FM_HOME` determines Herdr's home label: the primary home uses `firstmate`, and a secondmate home marked by `.fm-secondmate-home` uses `2ndmate-<secondmate-id>`.
[`herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md#watching-and-task-containers) owns launcher-bound workspace placement, the label-only fallback, collision handling, and recovery behavior.
The optional local `config/herdr-presentation-spaces` presence flag instead enables Herdr's default-off disposable single-task visual projection; [Optional presentation spaces](herdr-backend.md#optional-presentation-spaces) owns its behavior, safety limits, recovery contract, and narrow locked session-start cleanup of exact restored idle-shell children.
The flag is default-off and inherited into secondmate homes under the primary-authoritative contract owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
For normal herdr operations, `HERDR_SESSION` selects the named session, but destructive test cleanup must not rely on `HERDR_SESSION` alone.
Use the explicit guarded cleanup path described in [`docs/herdr-backend.md`](herdr-backend.md) instead of `herdr server stop`.
For normal zellij operations, `FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` selects the named session and defaults to `firstmate`.
Zellij has no per-home workspace split: primary and secondmate tasks share that one session, and visible tab titles are scoped by the active `FM_HOME` readable label plus a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
Use the guarded cleanup path described in [`docs/zellij-backend.md`](zellij-backend.md) instead of `kill-all-sessions` or `delete-all-sessions`.
cmux has no session layer at all - one workspace per task, in whatever cmux window is open - and its socket password (when configured) is read from local, gitignored `config/cmux-socket-password` under the effective config directory, never committed.
The caller-facing label remains `fm-<id>`, but the actual cmux workspace title is scoped by the active `FM_HOME` readable label plus a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path as `fm-<home-label>-<id>`.
Test cleanup must use the guarded path in [`docs/cmux-backend.md`](cmux-backend.md#current-operation-and-safety), never enumerate-and-close every workspace.
`config/backend` is inherited into secondmate homes under the primary-authoritative contract owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).

## The ONE dispatch file (config/dispatch.json)

`config/dispatch.json` is the single file that owns dispatch and routing for a home. It is LOCAL and gitignored, like every other `config/` item. It replaces the five separate files that used to carry the same five concerns, and every one of those five files still works as a compatibility fallback so an existing home, a secondmate home, and an older install all keep resolving exactly as they did.

`bin/fm-harness.sh` is the single owner of this file's schema and of the key names. Every other reader asks it for a value rather than parsing the file again.

```json
{
  "_comment": "ONE dispatch file. Owns the harness, the model, the effort, the lane ceilings and the routing rules.",
  "harness": "minimax-code",
  "model": "minimax/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash",
  "effort": "",
  "secondmate": { "harness": "minimax-code", "model": "minimax/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash", "effort": "" },
  "max_lanes": 12,
  "max_provider_lanes": 6,
  "route": { "_mode": {}, "rules": [], "default": [] }
}
```

Every key is optional. A file with only `harness` is valid, and a file with no `route` key is valid and means "this file configures no routing rules".
A `config/dispatch.json` that exists but does not parse is a BROKEN configuration, not an absent one: it is reported (`DISPATCH_CONFIG: invalid config/dispatch.json - malformed JSON`) and never silently replaced by the legacy routing file, because quietly routing on a different ruleset is the failure mode this file exists to prevent.

| Key | Owns | Legacy fallback, consulted second |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `harness` | the adapter for crewmate and scout launches | `config/crew-harness` |
| `model` | the primary's own model pin | none |
| `effort` | the primary's own effort pin | none |
| `secondmate.harness` | the adapter the primary launches secondmates on | `config/secondmate-harness` (1st token) |
| `secondmate.model` | the model the primary launches secondmates on | `config/secondmate-harness` (2nd token) |
| `secondmate.effort` | the effort the primary launches secondmates on | `config/secondmate-harness` (3rd token) |
| `max_lanes` | the live-lane ceiling | `config/dispatch-max-lanes` |
| `max_provider_lanes` | the per-provider lane ceiling | `config/dispatch-max-provider-lanes` |
| `route` | the routing rules, in the `config/crew-dispatch.json` schema verbatim | `config/crew-dispatch.json` |

The exact resolution order:

- crew harness: `dispatch.json` `.harness` -> `config/crew-harness` -> the firstmate's own harness.
- secondmate harness: `dispatch.json` `.secondmate.harness` -> `config/secondmate-harness` 1st token -> the crew harness resolution.
- secondmate model: `dispatch.json` `.secondmate.model` -> `config/secondmate-harness` 2nd token -> nothing.
- secondmate effort: `dispatch.json` `.secondmate.effort` -> `config/secondmate-harness` 3rd token -> nothing.
- live-lane ceiling: `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_LANES` -> `dispatch.json` `.max_lanes` -> `config/dispatch-max-lanes` -> 4.
- per-provider ceiling: `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_PROVIDER_LANES` -> `dispatch.json` `.max_provider_lanes` -> `config/dispatch-max-provider-lanes` -> the global ceiling.
- routing rules: `dispatch.json` `.route` -> `config/crew-dispatch.json` -> no rules.

A configured value of `default` means "not configured" and defers to the next source, exactly like the legacy files.

### HOW THE CAPTAIN CHANGES THE ROUTE

One file, one set of keys. The route is changed by editing `config/dispatch.json` in the home and nothing else.

- Change the adapter every crewmate and scout spawns on: set `"harness"` at the top level.
- Change the model every secondmate spawns on: set `"secondmate": { "model": "..." }`.
- Change the reasoning effort for secondmates: set `"secondmate": { "effort": "high" }`.
- Change the live-lane ceiling: set `"max_lanes"`.
- Change the per-provider ceiling: set `"max_provider_lanes"`.
- Change the routing RULES (which profile matches which kind of task): set the `"route"` object, whose `rules` and `default` arrays use the `config/crew-dispatch.json` schema unchanged.

To route the whole fleet to MCode, the whole edit is:

```json
{
  "harness": "minimax-code",
  "model": "minimax/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash",
  "secondmate": { "harness": "minimax-code", "model": "minimax/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash" },
  "max_lanes": 12,
  "max_provider_lanes": 6
}
```

### The configured-route gate (bin/fm-dispatch-guard.sh)

While a home's CONFIGURED route harness is `minimax-code`, the dispatch guard refuses a spawn on the Pi family (`pi` and `pi-signed`), because the standing directive is that the free MCode route is the route. The rule is conditional on the CONFIGURED route, never on the ambient detected harness: a home that configures nothing keeps whatever it had, and a home that configures `pi` keeps its Pi lanes. The refusal names the configured route and the escape hatch. `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_ROUTE_BYPASS=1` skips this one check and is logged as `BYPASS_ROUTE`; the global `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_BYPASS=1` does not rescue it.

The retired slug `minimax/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash-Preview` is refused outright with no bypass, like the `gpt-6.1-sol` ban, because the catalog no longer serves it. The live id is `minimax/MiniMax-M3.1-Flash`.

### Inheritance

`config/dispatch.json` is in the declared inheritable set, so the primary's one file propagates to every secondmate home's `config/` and the secondmate's own crewmates resolve the same harness, model, effort, ceilings, and routing rules. The legacy files stay in the same inheritable set, so a primary that has not migrated yet still converges. `config/secondmate-harness` is still not inherited, because secondmates do not spawn secondmates.

## Dispatch lane ceilings (config/dispatch.json / config/dispatch-max-lanes / config/dispatch-max-provider-lanes)

`config/dispatch.json` is the ONE dispatch file and is the primary source for the lane ceilings: `.max_lanes` sets the home-local maximum for all working or unknown worker lanes, and `.max_provider_lanes` sets the corresponding per-provider maximum. The legacy `config/dispatch-max-lanes` and `config/dispatch-max-provider-lanes` files remain supported as compatibility fallbacks and are consulted only when the one file does not set the value. Both shapes hold a positive decimal integer, and the per-provider ceiling defaults to the global ceiling when absent or invalid. `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_LANES` and `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_PROVIDER_LANES` override their respective config values. Provider identity is read from the provider prefix in each task's recorded `model=` when present, otherwise from its recorded `harness=`; unknown or unreadable lane state occupies both applicable ceilings.

The ceiling is enforced by `bin/fm-dispatch-guard.sh` (`fm_dispatch_guard_lane_cap`), which `bin/fm-spawn.sh` calls before it spawns. The Herdr subagent cap (`MAX_SUBAGENT_PANES` / `MAX_TOTAL_PANES`, `cap.sh`) is a separate, pane-level ceiling on top of it.

**`config/parallel-dispatch-cap` is retired and is not implemented.** It was a legacy file that
existed only in the retired `/home/hd2admin/kun-agent-workspace` home
(`data/hd2-takeover/report-ticket-0001-0008-surface-roster-and-fast-tier.md` §2.2 retires that home
as non-authoritative). It was never present in this repository, and no reader for it ever existed
here — `tests/fm-spawn-batch.test.sh` covers batch argument routing, not a task-count cap. Adding a
third, separately-configured concurrency gate to `bin/fm-spawn.sh` would let two ceilings disagree
about the same host, so the file is retired rather than implemented. The live ceiling is
`config/dispatch.json` `.max_lanes` and the per-provider ceiling is `config/dispatch.json`
`.max_provider_lanes`, with `config/dispatch-max-lanes` and
`config/dispatch-max-provider-lanes` as the legacy fallbacks.


## Choosing a capacity (config/dispatch.json)

The live-lane ceiling is `.max_lanes` and the per-provider ceiling is `.max_provider_lanes`, and `config/dispatch.json` is the only place either one is configured.
This section owns the RULE for choosing a capacity, and it does not repeat the schema of the file, which the section "The ONE dispatch file (config/dispatch.json)" above owns, nor the mechanical resolution of the ceilings, which the section "Dispatch lane ceilings" above owns.

### An exported environment variable beats the configured value

The guard reads the environment before it reads the file.
In [`bin/fm-dispatch-guard.sh`](bin/fm-dispatch-guard.sh), the live-lane cap resolution seeds itself from `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_LANES` at line 310 and reads `.max_lanes` from `config/dispatch.json` only when that environment value is empty, at line 311.
The per-provider cap resolution seeds itself from `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_PROVIDER_LANES` at line 337 and reads `.max_provider_lanes` only when that environment value is empty, at line 338.
The guard's own header records the same precedence: line 28 documents `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_LANES=<n>` as an override of `config/dispatch.json` `.max_lanes`, and line 30 documents `FM_DISPATCH_GUARD_MAX_PROVIDER_LANES=<n>` as an override of `.max_provider_lanes`.
So an exported environment variable wins over the configured value, and an operator who wants the configured value to be the truth must make sure that no such variable is exported in the shell that dispatches.
An ambient override that is read ahead of the durable config makes the durable config a lie: the file says one number and the environment silently decides another.
That is why a capacity belongs in `config/dispatch.json` and not in a shell profile.

### How to change a capacity

Change the one file: edit `config/dispatch.json`, set `.max_lanes` and `.max_provider_lanes` there, and change nothing else.
Then run `bin/fm-config-push.sh` to propagate the new ceilings to the second mate homes, which inherit the one file from the primary.

### What each ceiling counts

The two ceilings count different things.
The live-lane ceiling counts live crewmate lanes, counted per window or pane rather than per session: the guard's own refusal says so at line 397 of [`bin/fm-dispatch-guard.sh`](bin/fm-dispatch-guard.sh), and the inventory it counts walks the recorded lane metas from line 360.
The per-provider ceiling counts the lanes attributed to a provider, and that attribution is read out of the recorded lane metadata: `fm_dispatch_guard_provider_of_meta` at line 326 reads the provider prefix of a meta's recorded `model=` and falls back to its recorded `harness=`, and the guard attributes each lane to that provider at line 365.
The per-provider ceiling is then applied to each provider separately at line 401.

### The per-provider ceiling binds a credential account

The per-provider ceiling binds a CREDENTIAL ACCOUNT, and not a provider name and not a host.
Two surfaces that hold the same credential for a provider draw the same pool, so the fleet total for that pool is reconciled across the surfaces that share it before the configured number is treated as final, and a surface that raises its own ceiling does not entitle it to lanes on an account it does not hold.
A pool that is genuinely one account across every surface is the fleet-wide limit, and the pool whose number binds everybody is the one that matters.
The account map that says which pools are shared and which are not is measured configuration, so it lives in `route._mode.account_map` in each surface's own `config/dispatch.json`, and a reader never has to re-derive it from a reading.
A provider name alone is not evidence of a shared pool: the same provider can be one account on one surface and a different account on another, and the proof is the credential-store digest and the reset instants read on each surface, not the name.
As of 2026-10-21 the MiniMax credential on the Hetz host is held by that host alone, and the Codex credential on it is `codex-home` plus `openai-codex`, while zai/GLM is a single account across every credentialed surface, so zai is the pool whose number binds the whole fleet.

### A capacity expires like a route does

A capacity number whose reason expires is operational configuration and not documentation, so it lives in `config/dispatch.json` with its expiry beside it.
That is the shape the route already uses: the `route._mode` object carries the reason, the date it expires, and the action that retires it, and this file owns the rule for choosing a route and never the route that is chosen right now.
A capacity decision follows the same rule, so `route._mode` carries `capacity_reason`, `capacity_expires` and `capacity_expires_action` beside the route's own fields, and this file owns the rule for choosing a capacity and never the number that is chosen right now.
As of 2026-10-21 the Hetz home runs a live-lane ceiling of 12 and a per-provider ceiling of 6, and that is a dated record of a measured decision whose reason expires on 2026-10-25, not a permanent value, so a later reader can tell a measured window from a policy.
The 12 is this host's own allocation and the 6 is the ceiling on one credential account, for the reason the section above gives: the per-provider ceiling binds an account rather than a provider name, and one surface's MiniMax lane is not another surface's MiniMax lane unless they hold the same credential, so the two ceilings are deliberately different numbers and this host may not raise its per-provider ceiling to match its own live-lane ceiling.
The authoritative number lives in that home's own `config/dispatch.json`, never in this document.

### The second ceiling: the treehouse worktree pool

There is a second, separate ceiling, and it is not in `config/dispatch.json`.
The treehouse worktree pool refuses a dispatch outright with `all N worktrees are in use or dirty (max_trees = M)`, and that pool ceiling is the `max_trees` value in `treehouse.toml` at the repository root.
There are two ceilings because they bound two different things, a worktree slot and a lane: the treehouse ceiling binds when the pool has no free or reclaimable slot, and the lane ceiling binds when the host or the shared provider account runs out of lanes.


## Away-mode supervisor backend (FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND / FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET)

The `/afk` sub-supervisor injects escalation digests into firstmate's own pane independently of where new task endpoints are spawned.
It currently supports only `tmux` and `herdr` supervisor panes.
Set `FM_SUPERVISOR_BACKEND=tmux|herdr` and `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET=<target>` to override both axes explicitly; for herdr the target is `"<session>:<pane-id>"`.
Without overrides, backend detection uses `$TMUX_PANE` first, then `HERDR_ENV=1` with `HERDR_PANE_ID`, then falls back to `tmux`.
That keeps a tmux pane nested inside herdr on the tmux transport, matching the runtime backend's innermost-first rule.
Target detection uses `FM_SUPERVISOR_TARGET`, then `$TMUX_PANE`, then `"${HERDR_SESSION:-default}:${HERDR_PANE_ID}"` under herdr, then the legacy `firstmate:0` tmux fallback with a warning.
Selecting any other supervisor backend, including `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux`, refuses at daemon startup instead of trying tmux injection primitives against a non-tmux pane.

## Away-mode wedge alarm channels (config/wedge-alarm)

When away-mode injection wedges past `FM_MAX_DEFER_SECS`, the sub-supervisor raises a loud, rate-limited alarm.
Beyond the durable `state/.subsuper-inject-wedged` marker and the tmux status-line flash, it attempts a configured backend-independent active alert that can reach the captain even when every pane and its backend status-line is unreadable.
`config/wedge-alarm` (local, gitignored) lists channel directives, one per non-empty, non-comment line; every listed non-`off` channel fires, best-effort.
`FM_WEDGE_ALARM_CHANNEL` overrides the file with a single directive.
Directives are `off` (a position-independent kill switch that disables every active alert), `auto`/`default`, `osascript` (macOS Notification Center banner), `herdr` (herdr UI notification), and `command:<cmd>` (run `<cmd>` via `sh -c`, summary on `$1` and stdin).
An absent file means `auto`, i.e. default-on on macOS: the alarm exists precisely so a wedged away-mode primary is never silent, and it fires at most once per max-defer window after a genuine wedge.
A missing or failing channel logs and falls through to the next, never crashing the daemon.
See [`wedge-alarm.md`](wedge-alarm.md) for the current channel reference, [`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#wedge-alarm-channels) for active evidence, and [`examples/wedge-alarm`](examples/wedge-alarm) for a copyable config.

## Gate defaults (.no-mistakes.yaml)

The tracked `.no-mistakes.yaml` keeps test evidence outside the repo and pins `commands.lint` to `bin/fm-lint.sh` so local lint matches CI.
That evidence policy is specific to the firstmate repo: target projects may legitimately commit `.no-mistakes/evidence/` from their own no-mistakes pipeline, but firstmate keeps `.no-mistakes/` local and CI rejects tracked entries under that path.
It does not set `commands.test` to a complete `tests/*.test.sh` walk.
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the firstmate-specific local test policy and entry points.
Portable shard evidence and coverage rules are in [fm-test-portable-shards.md](fm-test-portable-shards.md); [herdr-backend.md](herdr-backend.md#destructive-lab-safety) owns the real-Herdr lane's isolation boundary, and [runtime-backends.md](verification/runtime-backends.md#herdr) owns active evidence.

## Captain Preferences (data/captain.md / data/captain-shared.md)

Domain-local preferences for one captain's fleet live locally in each home's `data/captain.md`; it is gitignored and printed in the session-start context digest after `data/projects.md` and optional `data/secondmates.md`.
Before changing it, inspect the current file and rewrite or prune the matching bullet in place; add a new bullet only for a genuinely new durable preference.
Shared captain preferences that apply across secondmate domains live only in the primary home's optional `data/captain-shared.md`.
`secondmate-provisioning` owns its propagation contract, including the required header, read-only secondmate copies, quarantine diagnostics, and the rollout rule that existing homes trim `data/captain.md` by hand after first propagation rather than deleting private content automatically.

## Operational learnings (data/learnings.md)

Fleet-local operational facts and gotchas live locally in `data/learnings.md`; it is gitignored and printed after the captain-preference files in the session-start context digest.
The file is created lazily on first learning and follows the same dated, evidence-backed, curated style as `data/captain.md`: inspect the current file first, then rewrite or prune stale entries instead of appending forever.
There is no shared learnings file by captain decision.

## Startup memory budget (config/startup-memory-budget)

`config/startup-memory-budget` is the primary-authoritative per-home allowance for the startup prompt-memory surface: `data/captain.md`, `data/captain-shared.md`, and `data/learnings.md` together.
The locked mutable bootstrap path materializes its visible default of `7500` estimated tokens in a primary home when the file is absent.
To select another allowance, replace the primary home's file with one valid positive value in the exact format below; the next locked bootstrap convergence or `bin/fm-config-push.sh` propagates it to registered secondmates.
A secondmate does not create an independent default and instead receives the primary value through the inherited-local-material contract in [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md).
The file must be one positive base-10 integer followed by exactly one newline in a regular, single-linked file beneath a non-symlinked `config/` directory.
Malformed, multi-line, symlinked, hardlinked, special, or otherwise unsafe values are rejected rather than treated as a default.
Use `bin/fm-startup-memory-budget.sh read` to validate and print the effective value, or `bin/fm-startup-memory-budget.sh report` to account for the three files.
The stable local estimate is `ceil(UTF-8 bytes / 3)` per file, a conservative portable approximation rather than a provider-exact tokenizer.
An inherited `data/captain-shared.md` counts in a secondmate's total but remains primary-owned and read-only there.
The internal `/stow` skill curates only the editable local files in that case and reports the primary-owned shared file as a concrete exception if it alone exceeds the budget.
The helper's header owns exact parsing, publication, and report output mechanics.

## Secondmate routes (data/secondmates.md)

Persistent secondmate routes live locally in `data/secondmates.md`.
The concise single-line route contract is owned by the [`secondmate-provisioning` skill](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md#routing-table), including the parser-compatible fields, one-sentence summary requirement, `home:` pointer to the seeded charter, and limit on extra registry prose.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh validate` to check the complete operational registry contract documented by the command itself.
The main first mate routes by reading those scopes with judgment; the project list is provisioning data, not exclusive ownership.
Use `fm-home-seed.sh <id> - {<project>...|--no-projects}` to lease a fresh firstmate worktree for the secondmate home.
Use the deliberate `--no-projects` signal only for a firstmate-repo domain that needs no separate project clones.
It cannot be combined with a project list, and omitting both still fails loudly.
A project-less seed requires no existing project clones or `data/projects.md` entries in the home, so it refuses a populated-home conversion without changing that home.
A preexisting project-bearing charter is also refused until it is re-scaffolded with `--no-projects` or removed.
The lease is held under the secondmate id until explicit retirement or seed rollback returns it, so normal restarts do not free or recycle the home.
Teardown of a leased home fails closed if `treehouse return` cannot release the lease; plain-clone homes with no treehouse pool slot are removed directly.
Secondmate routes cover `no-mistakes` and `direct-PR` projects; `local-only` projects remain main-firstmate work.
For `no-mistakes` projects, seeding initializes only projects newly cloned into a secondmate home and refuses to mutate a preexisting clone that is not already initialized.
After creating a secondmate, move existing main-backlog queued items that you have judged in-scope with `fm-backlog-handoff.sh <secondmate-id> <item-key>...`; it is idempotent and refuses In flight, Done, or non-secondmate homes.
Set `FM_SECONDMATE_CHARTER` to seed from inline charter text when no filled charter brief exists; set `FM_SECONDMATE_SCOPE` when the routing scope should differ from the charter text.
The seeded home's `data/charter.md` owns the standard secondmate lifecycle and escalation contract; the route file points to it through the existing `home:` field instead of adding another pointer.
Each seed writes an `.fm-secondmate-home` identity marker at the home root.
The tracked root `.gitignore` ignores that marker, so validation can read it without making a freshly seeded home appear dirty to porcelain-based safety checks.
This does not relax protection for any other untracked file.
An existing linked-worktree home that predates this rule advances through its marker-only state during its next bootstrap or spawn local sync, after which Git ignores the marker normally.
A standalone-clone home cannot receive a primary-local commit through that no-fetch sync, so it receives the rule through `/updatefirstmate`'s origin refresh instead.

## FM_HOME

`FM_HOME` selects the operational home for one firstmate instance.
When it is unset, most scripts use the repo root as the home; when it is set, scripts still run from this repo's `bin/`, but `state/`, `data/`, `config/`, and `projects/` come from `$FM_HOME`.
`FM_ROOT_OVERRIDE` overrides the firstmate repo root used by scripts, including the primary checkout watched by the worktree-tangle guard.
When `FM_HOME` is unset, it also behaves as the old whole-root override.
`bin/fm-send.sh` is intentionally stricter than that general fallback: it requires `FM_HOME` to be set before resolving a target, so operator steers cannot silently resolve against the wrong home.
`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE`, `FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE`, and `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` override individual operational directories for tests and specialized harness setup.
Before `fm-brief.sh`, `fm-spawn.sh`, or `fm-afk-launch.sh` persists a path or passes it to another process, it resolves each applicable relative `FM_HOME`, `FM_STATE_OVERRIDE`, or `FM_DATA_OVERRIDE` directory against the caller's working directory, preserves absolute spellings unchanged, and rejects an unresolvable relative directory with the offending variable named.
Bootstrap applies the same relative `FM_HOME` resolution only when embedding that home in the generated X-mode poll shim; other transient consumers retain their existing shell-relative behavior.
For the herdr backend, `FM_HOME` also determines the workspace label used by the adapter.
For the zellij backend, `FM_HOME` does not split containers, but it determines the readable home prefix embedded in visible tab titles; use `FM_ZELLIJ_SESSION` when a separate zellij session is needed.
The full zellij home label also includes a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path.
For the cmux backend, `FM_CONFIG_OVERRIDE` overrides where `config/cmux-socket-password` is read from, while `FM_HOME` determines the default config path and readable home prefix embedded in workspace titles.
The full cmux home label also includes a short hash of the resolved `FM_ROOT` path, and there is no per-home container split.

## Steer delivery outcomes (bin/fm-send.sh)

Delivery and confirmation are two separate facts, and `bin/fm-send.sh` never collapses them into one non-zero exit code.
It types the line once, sends Enter (and retries only Enter), and then asks the target backend for a proof-carrying verdict.
That verdict selects exactly one of three outcomes, and the exit code is the caller contract:

| Exit | Outcome | Meaning | Caller action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | delivered and confirmed | the backend positively acknowledged the submit (verdict `empty`) and the parent's durable delivery record was committed | treat the steer as landed |
| `1` | not delivered | the text never reached the target: the backend send itself failed (verdict `send-failed`, or the backend refused the send) | safe to retry; nothing was typed |
| `2` | delivered, not fully confirmed | the text reached the target but the outcome could not be closed out on the parent side: either the submit was not positively confirmed (verdict `pending`, `pending-unproven`, `unknown`) or the parent's durable delivery record could not be committed | do NOT retry; treat the delivery as made and keep a durable expectation |

Exit `2` is deliberately non-zero, so a confirmed swallow still fails loudly to the caller.
The distinction exists because an empty-composer proof has known false-negative classes (dim suggestion text, ghost rows, a stale read), so an inconclusive confirmation is not evidence of a non-delivery; the repo's own precedent is `fm_task_inbox_ring` in `bin/fm-task-inbox-lib.sh`, where only `send-failed` counts as a failed keystroke and every other verdict is "never proof".
On the `2` path `fm-send.sh` keeps the parent-owned pending-reply expectation in its attempted-but-unconfirmed state instead of discarding it, so `bin/fm-pending-reply-lib.sh` can promote it to `delivery_unknown` and escalate it if the target never acknowledges.
A genuine non-delivery is never reported as success, and the `--key` path, the retired-slug ban, the Sol ban, and the configured-route gate are unaffected by this contract.

## Fresh-agent baseline resolution (FM_BASELINE_*)

Every fresh agent and every generated brief begins with the `fresh-agent-baseline/v1` pointer manifest, whose policy-family roles resolve from the home rather than from any fixed absolute path.
Each role resolves in order: that role's override variable, then `$FM_HOME`, then the operator's account home `$HOME`.
A candidate must be a readable regular file; anything else is skipped so resolution falls through to the next home.
`FM_BASELINE_POLICY`, `FM_BASELINE_PROJECT_POLICY`, `FM_BASELINE_ROUTING`, `FM_BASELINE_BOUNDED`, and `FM_BASELINE_LEAN_CTX` each pin one role to an explicit path, for a home that keeps that document somewhere the defaults do not reach.
An override that names an unreadable path leaves the role unresolved rather than falling through, so a bad override is never silently masked by a default.
A role with no readable candidate is emitted as `<role>=unavailable (no home-local file on this host)`: the role keeps its line, and the line carries no path and no digest, so a missing contract is visible to the fresh agent instead of being dropped or pointed at another host's file.
The `warehouse` and `warehouse-preflight` pointers stay fail-closed: `FM_BASELINE_ROOT` still selects their root, and a missing one aborts manifest emission rather than emitting a partial baseline.
`bin/fm-baseline-lib.sh` owns the candidate order and the unavailable marker for both emitters.

## Harness support

claude, codex, opencode, pi, pi-signed, grok, kimi, agy, and minimax-code are empirically verified for crewmate and secondmate launches; [`bin/fm-harness.sh`](../bin/fm-harness.sh) owns that list as the single source of truth, and [README requirements](../README.md#requirements) own the set supported for the primary session.
New harnesses get verified through a supervised trial task before joining the set.
The verified adapter knowledge - each harness's busy-state source, interrupt and exit commands, skill-invocation syntax, and per-harness quirks - lives in [`.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md`](../.agents/skills/harness-adapters/SKILL.md).
Launch mechanics, including the verified command templates, live in [`bin/fm-spawn.sh`](../bin/fm-spawn.sh).
Enabled primary-session turn-end guard integrations are tracked as repo-level hook files and documented in [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md).
Kimi remains outside the primary turn-end guard integrations; [`docs/turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#compatibility-limits) owns its separate captain-approved crew wake hook.
Primary-session watcher wake protocols are rendered at session start by [`bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh`](../bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh) from [`docs/supervision-protocols/`](supervision-protocols/).
Claude's Stop `asyncRewake` hook owns tokenless re-arm cycles, Grok uses background-notify cycles, Codex uses bounded foreground checkpoints, Pi and pi-signed use the same two tracked primary extensions, and OpenCode uses its TUI plugin.
`config/dispatch.json` `.harness` is the adapter name for crewmate and scout launches; the legacy `config/crew-harness` is a local, gitignored file containing one adapter name and is the compatibility fallback, consulted only when the one file does not set the value.
When pi-signed is selected, Firstmate launches the executable named `pi-signed` from `PATH` with `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi-signed` and refuses the launch if it is unavailable rather than falling back to pi.
Plain Pi launches set `FM_PI_HARNESS=pi`, so a signed primary's environment cannot relabel a plain Pi worker.
When the value is absent or contains `default`, crewmates mirror the firstmate's own harness.
`config/dispatch.json` `.secondmate.harness` is the adapter the primary uses to launch secondmate agents; the legacy `config/secondmate-harness` is a separate local, gitignored file containing that adapter, optionally followed by model and effort tokens on the same line, and is the compatibility fallback.
The first non-empty, non-comment line is parsed as `<harness> [<model>] [<effort>]`.
A bare `<harness>` preserves the previous behavior: harness only, with no model or effort launch flag.
When the secondmate harness token is absent or `default`, secondmate launch falls back through the crew harness resolution and then the primary's own harness, and no model or effort is read from that file.
`fm-harness.sh secondmate-model` and `fm-harness.sh secondmate-effort` expose the optional secondmate model and effort tokens; `config/crew-harness` remains a bare adapter-name file.
An explicit harness argument to `fm-spawn.sh` still overrides either config source for that spawn only.
An explicit `--model` or `--effort` overrides the matching configured token; an explicit harness or raw launch command starts with clean model and effort defaults unless those flags are also passed.
When routing rules exist, crewmate and scout spawns require an explicit resolved harness instead of automatically falling back to the configured crew harness.
The inherited-local-material contract is owned by [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md); its harness-relevant consequence is that a secondmate's own crewmates use the primary's dispatch profiles and static harness value.
Those inherited values are defaults and rules only; `fm-spawn` still permits a consciously chosen explicit runtime outside the config.
`config/secondmate-harness` is not inherited because secondmates do not launch secondmates.
For grok, `fm-spawn.sh` installs one firstmate-owned global turn-end hook under `$GROK_HOME/hooks/`, or `~/.grok/hooks/` when `GROK_HOME` is unset, and drops a per-task `.fm-grok-turnend` pointer in the worktree, with teardown removing the task token and pointer.
For Kimi crews, `fm-spawn.sh` runs `fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh install`, drops a per-task `.fm-kimi-turnend` pointer in the worktree, and records the matching private registry token for teardown.
Kimi continues to use the captain's normal Kimi home, including the existing config, skills, and memory; Firstmate does not create an isolated Kimi home.
The Kimi installer requires an existing regular non-symlink `~/.kimi-code/config.toml`, `python3` with `tomllib`, and `jq`; it validates but never serializes the captain's TOML and refuses before writing when the config is missing, malformed, or surprising or when either tool requirement is unavailable.
Its `remove` action excises only the marker-delimited Firstmate region and removes Firstmate's hook files.
For Pi and pi-signed secondmate launches, `fm-spawn.sh` starts the selected executable with `-e` pointed at the secondmate home's own tracked `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts` and `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`, both already present from the secondmate home's git worktree.

### Batch spawn pacing

When `fm-spawn.sh` receives a batch of task pairs, it waits **250 ms** between
successive launches by default. This prevents a six-lane refill from bursting
all prompt submissions into the provider at once and triggering avoidable rate
limits. The delay is controlled by the numeric `FM_SPAWN_DISPATCH_DELAY_SEC`
environment variable for diagnostics or a deliberately different cadence; an
unset value resolves to `0.25`. The delay applies only between batch items and
does not change the launch command or the worker's retry budget.

## Crew dispatch profiles (config/dispatch.json route / config/crew-dispatch.json)

The routing rules live in `config/dispatch.json` under the `route` key, in the schema below unchanged; the legacy `config/crew-dispatch.json` is the compatibility fallback and is used when the one file has no `route` key.
Both shapes are optional local, gitignored files containing natural-language rules that firstmate reads before dispatching a crewmate or scout.
The shell scripts do not match those rules; firstmate chooses the best matching rule with judgment, resolves its profile object or array under the operating contract in `AGENTS.md` section 4 and `quota-array-dispatch`, and passes only concrete `--harness`, `--model`, and `--effort` flags to `fm-spawn.sh`.
When the rules are present, `fm-spawn.sh` enforces that contract by refusing crewmate and scout spawns that lack an explicit harness (`--harness`, a positional adapter, or a raw launch command).
Batch spawns satisfy the same requirement with a shared `--harness`.
Secondmate spawns are exempt and still resolve through the configured secondmate harness and its optional model and effort tokens.
This section is the single owner of the canonical schema and its per-field semantics.
`AGENTS.md` section 4 owns the always-loaded dispatch intake boundary, and `quota-array-dispatch` owns the completion-aware profile-array selection procedure.

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "when": "<natural-language condition describing a kind of task>",
      "use": [
        { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<low|medium|high|xhigh|max, optional>" }
      ],
      "why": "<optional rationale that helps firstmate choose>"
    }
  ],
  "default": [
    { "harness": "<adapter>", "model": "<optional model>", "effort": "<optional effort>" }
  ]
}
```

Per rule, `when` and `use` are required.
Both `use` and the optional top-level `default` accept either one profile object or a non-empty array of profile objects.
The single-object form stays fully backward-compatible, and every profile needs `harness`.
Profile `model` and `effort` fields and rule `why` are optional.
An omitted model or effort means the selected harness uses its own default for that axis.
Every profile array is an implicit quota-aware choice resolved through `quota-array-dispatch`.
If no dispatch rule fits, firstmate resolves `default` through the same object-or-array path before falling back to `config/crew-harness`.
If a selected profile carries an effort value the chosen harness does not accept, `fm-spawn.sh` records the requested `effort=` in task meta for traceability but omits the launch flag, and bootstrap reports the invalid harness/effort pair as a `CREW_DISPATCH` diagnostic when it is visible in the file.
See [`docs/examples/crew-dispatch.json`](examples/crew-dispatch.json) for a starting point to copy into the `route` object of local `config/dispatch.json`, or into local `config/crew-dispatch.json`.
When the file exists, bootstrap validates it with `jq`.
Valid files stay silent by default; with `FM_BOOTSTRAP_VERBOSE_FACTS=1`, bootstrap emits `BOOTSTRAP_INFO: crew dispatch active config/crew-dispatch.json` (or `config/dispatch.json route`), one `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:` fact per rule, and one fact for the optional default profile set.
Malformed JSON, an empty or malformed rule/default array, an unverified harness, or an effort value unsupported by that harness is reported as `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/crew-dispatch.json - ...` (or `CREW_DISPATCH: invalid config/dispatch.json route - ...` when the rules live in the one file); missing `jq` is reported through the normal `MISSING: jq` install-consent flow.
While the rules remain present, no crewmate or scout spawn may proceed without an explicit resolved harness; malformed configuration must be reported and corrected rather than selected around.
Secondmate homes inherit both the one file and the legacy file from the primary, so a secondmate's own crewmates apply the same dispatch profile behavior.

### Dispatch rule field semantics

This subsection owns the per-field meaning of a dispatch rule, because a second mate that has to spawn its own crews must be able to tell the spawn route from the fields that are not one.
`when` is the natural-language condition that firstmate matches the task against, and firstmate reads it, never a script.
`use` holds the profile object or profile array that the matched rule selects.
`why` is optional rationale that helps firstmate choose between rules.
`harness` is the adapter name and is the spawn route, passed to `fm-spawn.sh` as `--harness`.
`model` is the optional model slug, passed to `fm-spawn.sh` as `--model`.
`effort` is the optional reasoning-effort value, passed to `fm-spawn.sh` as `--effort`.
A profile therefore selects exactly this command: `bin/fm-spawn.sh <task-id> --harness <harness> --model <model> [--effort <effort>]`.

`agent` is the name of a PI SUBAGENT profile used by the PRIMARY's own in-session delegation.
It is not an `fm-spawn.sh` route, no `fm-spawn.sh` consumer reads it, and a second mate must ignore it.
A profile that also names `agent` still spawns through its `harness`, `model`, and `effort` fields.

`harness: "controller"` is not a harness name.
It means the reviewing firstmate reviews the deliverable DIRECTLY and NOTHING is spawned.
Never pass `controller` to `fm-spawn.sh`; it refuses it with "error: unknown harness 'controller'".

`fm-spawn.sh` refuses to guess.
With `config/crew-dispatch.json` present, a crewmate or scout spawn without an explicit `--harness` is refused with "config/crew-dispatch.json is active - pass an explicit harness resolved from the dispatch rules (the consultation backstop, so the rules are never silently skipped)".
That refusal is the backstop, not an error to work around.
**Known gap:** `fm-spawn.sh` still detects the backstop by the presence of `config/crew-dispatch.json` alone, so a home that keeps its rules only under `config/dispatch.json` `.route` does not get that refusal until `fm-spawn.sh` learns the one file. The primary must keep `config/crew-dispatch.json` in place until that check is widened.

### Dispatch profile spawn blocks

A rule's `use` object may carry a `spawn` object that states the exact command for that rule, so that a second mate never has to reconstruct it from the fields and never guesses.

`spawn.harness`, `spawn.model` and `spawn.effort` are the values to pass to `bin/fm-spawn.sh`.
`spawn.command` is the literal command line for a reader, and it must agree with the other three.
`spawn.note` is optional, and carries anything a reader needs to know that the command line does not say.
A `spawn` object is documentation, not a second source of truth: `fm-spawn.sh` reads `harness`, `model` and `effort` from the profile itself, and never from `spawn`.

A profile that names a harness with no single authoritative provider family in the quota table carries an explicit `provider` field, and a profile without one is rejected by the resolver.
[`docs/examples/crew-dispatch.json`](examples/crew-dispatch.json) is the general worked example of the multi-provider shape, and [`docs/examples/crew-dispatch-single-route.json`](examples/crew-dispatch-single-route.json) is a worked example of a single-route profile with an explicit provider, where the route is chosen for a reason that expires.

### Which route a dispatch profile names, and who decides it

The CURRENT route lives in `config/dispatch.json` (the `route` object, or the harness keys), or in the legacy `config/crew-dispatch.json`, which is LOCAL and gitignored, and nowhere else.
A tracked document states the RULE for choosing a route, never the route that happens to be chosen right now.

That separation matters because a route is often chosen for a reason that expires: a free tier, a quota window, a promotion, a price change.
A dated sentence in a permanent document reads six weeks later as a standing fact, and a standing fact is not revisited.
So a routing decision whose reason has an end date is an operational configuration, it lives in `config/`, and it is changed when the reason changes.

The rule for choosing a route:

1. A route that is free, discounted, or inside a quota window is preferred, and the reason and its end date are recorded in the config that holds the route.
2. A lane uses a paid provider only when it genuinely needs that provider, and only after a fresh `quota-axi` reading shows the headroom.
3. When a window ends, re-read the quota and the cost before changing the route; a free window is a reason to prefer one route, not an exemption from the quota gate.
4. A dispatch profile that names a provider for a specific need, for example a web-connected lookup, keeps that rule and the quota reading that justifies it.
5. A tracked doc may reference the config and state this rule, and may record a dated decision as a dated record, but a dated record must carry the condition that retires it, so a later reader can tell a window from a policy.

## Toolchain

On session start the first mate detects what its required toolchain is missing or too old and lists each problem with either an exact install command or manual instructions.
It installs automatically supported tools only after you say go; manual-only tools remain for you to install from the printed instructions.
Required tools come in two parts: a universal toolchain every home needs regardless of backend, and a per-backend delta that follows the runtime backend actually resolved for this home.
The universal toolchain is node, git, gh with GitHub auth via `gh auth login`, no-mistakes v1.31.2 or newer, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, lavish-axi, compatible tasks-axi per "Backlog backend" above, and quota-axi v0.1.16 or newer.
This section is the single owner of that universal toolchain list; backend guides' prerequisites point here and add only their backend-specific tools.
In that list, no-mistakes runs the validation pipeline, gh-axi, chrome-devtools-axi, and lavish-axi cover GitHub, browser, and rich-review operations, and tasks-axi plus quota-axi back backlog mutations and quota-aware array dispatch.
The per-backend delta is required only for the backend resolved from `FM_BACKEND`, then `config/backend`, then runtime auto-detection, then default `tmux`, so a home is never told to install a tool an inactive backend or feature would need.
That delta is owned in code by `fm_backend_required_tools` in `bin/fm-backend.sh`: the resolved backend's own session-provider CLI (`tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `orca`, or `cmux`), `jq` for the JSON-emitting experimental adapters (`herdr`, `zellij`, `cmux`) whose spawn and liveness paths parse the backend's JSON output, and the `treehouse` worktree provider for every session-provider-only backend (`tmux`, `herdr`, `zellij`, `cmux`).
Backend tool availability uses the adapter's own executable resolver, so bootstrap and spawn agree on supported non-`PATH` locations such as cmux's bundled CLI.
An unknown resolved backend emits `BACKEND_INVALID` and blocks dispatch instead of silently dropping its dependency delta or falling back to tmux.
Orca provides both the task worktree and terminal endpoint (see "Runtime backend" above), so `backend=orca` requires only `orca` on top of the universal toolchain and skips both `treehouse` and every other backend's session CLI.
A herdr, zellij, or cmux home is therefore never told `tmux` is missing, and the `treehouse` durable-lease upgrade check runs only for the backends that actually use treehouse.
When `config/crew-dispatch.json` or `config/dispatch.json` exists, bootstrap also requires `jq` for dispatch profile validation.
When X mode is opted in, bootstrap also requires `curl` and `jq` before arming the relay poll shim.
`tasks-axi` and `quota-axi` are required bootstrap tools in every profile, the same class as `lavish-axi`.
An absent or incompatible `tasks-axi` reports `MISSING: tasks-axi (install: npm install -g tasks-axi)`; when `config/backlog-backend` is not `manual` and compatible `tasks-axi` is on `PATH`, bootstrap stays silent and firstmate uses its verbs for routine backlog mutations, otherwise it hand-edits `data/backlog.md` until installation is approved and completed.
An absent or too-old `quota-axi` reports `MISSING: quota-axi (install: npm install -g quota-axi)`; firstmate cannot resolve a profile array without a compatible binary.
That floor exists because it is the first build reporting per-credential auth sources, without which a candidate cannot be judged against the authentication surface it actually uses.
Bootstrap also reports a `TANGLE:` line when `FM_ROOT` is on a named non-default branch; follow the printed checkout remediation rather than treating it as an installable tool problem.
In a read-only session that did not get the fleet lock, the same line is advisory and omits the checkout command.
The locked session-start bootstrap step also runs a best-effort project clone refresh through `fm-fleet-sync.sh`.
It emits `FLEET_SYNC:` for skipped refreshes that may matter, recovered self-heals, and `STUCK:` alarms.
Normal completed runs keep local-only and no-origin skips silent.
If bootstrap kills a timed-out refresh, it replays any completed `fm-fleet-sync.sh` output before the aggregate timeout skip so no finished result is lost.
A killed refresh (or a teardown process kill) can leave an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock` in a clone, which makes the next refresh's fetch fail with Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists`.
On that signature only, `fm-fleet-sync.sh` retries the fetch with a bounded wait for the lock to self-clear, then removes the lock and retries once more only when it can prove the lock stale, exactly like the `fm-teardown.sh` `index.lock` recovery.
It never removes a live lock, leaves any other failure shape untouched, and prints every wait, retry, and removal to stderr plus a one-line `recovered:` summary to stdout on success so that this session-start relay still surfaces the recovery.
The locked session-start bootstrap step also runs the guarded local secondmate sync for recorded live secondmate homes, then propagates declared inherited local material into each validated live home.
It emits `SECONDMATE_SYNC:` only when a home was skipped for an actionable sync reason, inheritance failed, or a divergent shared captain-preference copy was quarantined.
When a running home advances and its loaded instruction surface (`AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, or `.agents/skills/`) changed, bootstrap sends the re-read nudge itself through the stable `fm-<id>` selector and reports the exact completed send as `BOOTSTRAP_INFO:`.
If that send fails, bootstrap keeps an idempotent retry marker and emits `NUDGE_SECONDMATES:` with the failure reason.
The same bootstrap run emits `SECONDMATE_LIVENESS:` only when a registered secondmate is skipped or its relaunch fails; already-live and successfully relaunched secondmates are handled silently.
For a mid-session inherited local-material edit where tracked-file sync is not needed, run `bin/fm-config-push.sh`.
It uses the same live secondmate discovery and propagation helper as bootstrap, prints each live home's `dispatch.json`, `crew-dispatch.json`, `crew-harness`, `backlog-backend`, `backend`, `herdr-presentation-spaces`, `startup-memory-budget`, and `data/captain-shared.md` result as `pushed`, `unchanged`, `skipped`, or `error`, and exits non-zero for real propagation errors or config-reread send failures.
When an allowlisted config item changes for an already-running home, it sends the literal-content reread pointer described in [`secondmate-provisioning`](../.agents/skills/secondmate-provisioning/SKILL.md); unchanged allowlisted config sends no pointer unless a previous delivery is pending.
A reread pointer is retired once it has been handed to the secondmate, and the pending marker that would re-queue it is removed in both the confirmed and the delivered-but-unconfirmed case, so the same generation can never be re-delivered forever.
Only a genuine non-delivery keeps the retry marker and reports the failure.
See "Steer delivery outcomes" above for the exit codes that separate those two facts.
The locked bootstrap inheritance pass uses the same per-home changed-set and reread path for already-running homes; see `secondmate-provisioning` for the single contract owner.
That live discovery starts from `state/*.meta` records with `kind=secondmate`; `data/secondmates.md` only backfills `home=` for older or incomplete meta records.
Skipped items, such as a destination checkout that does not yet gitignore the item, are visible warnings but not hard failures.

## X mode (.env)

X mode lets a firstmate instance answer public `@myfirstmate` mentions and act on normal reversible mention requests through firstmate's normal lifecycle.
It is off unless the firstmate home's gitignored `.env` contains a non-empty `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN`.
The pairing token both identifies the relay tenant and records opt-in consent for autonomous public replies and eligible lifecycle actions.
Destructive, irreversible, or security-sensitive asks are flagged for trusted-channel confirmation instead of being executed from a public mention.
The relay uses owner-only routing: a mention delivered to a home is from that home's owner/captain, while parent-thread context may still include other public accounts.
`FMX_RELAY_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://myfirstmate.io`, mainly for developers pointing at a local relay.
For direct client invocations, environment values override `.env`; bootstrap activation still keys off `.env` presence so watcher artifacts are explicit local opt-in state.
`FMX_ENV_FILE` can point direct poll/reply client invocations at another `.env`-style file, but it does not change bootstrap activation.

The locked session-start bootstrap step turns the token into local generated state.
It writes `state/x-watch.check.sh`, a byte-static identity shim for `bin/fm-x-poll.sh`, and `config/x-mode.env`, which exports `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL=30` for watcher processes in that home.
The watcher accepts the shim only when its bytes match the expected generated content, then invokes the trusted repository poll script directly instead of executing state-file source.
This section is the single owner of the X-mode cadence contract: an X instance polls every 30 seconds instead of the default 300, only an X instance speeds up because a non-X home has no `config/x-mode.env`, and the session-start supervision operating block includes the cadence instruction when that file exists.
The active primary-harness supervision protocol owns how that sourced cadence reaches the watcher process.
Because `bin/fm-watch.sh` reads `FM_CHECK_INTERVAL` only at process start, a cadence transition - opt-in while a watcher is already running, or opt-out - is applied by restarting the home-scoped watcher through the emitted harness protocol; bootstrap deliberately never restarts the watcher itself.
While away mode is active the daemon owns the watcher and its default cadence applies; away-mode X cadence is a deferred follow-up.
When the token is removed or empty, the next locked session-start bootstrap step removes those artifacts.
Steady-state off is silent and writes nothing.
X mode remains additive to non-X lifecycle behavior: homes without the generated artifacts keep the default watcher cadence and do not run the X poll.
Its request handling remains in X-specific `bin/` scripts and the `fmx-respond` skill, while the watcher owns authenticated dispatch from the generated local identity shim.

`bin/fm-x-poll.sh` calls `GET /connector/poll` with `Authorization: Bearer <FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN>`.
HTTP 204 is silent.
A newly offered pending mention with non-empty `text` is stored at `state/x-inbox/<request_id>.json` and wakes firstmate exactly once with `x-mention <request_id>`.
The poll atomically claims `state/x-context/<request_id>.offered.json` before emitting that wake, and subsequent offers of the same request stay silent even after the inbox is drained following an answer or dismiss.
Offer markers share the context registry's bounded seven-day retention, so losing or expiring the local marker lets a relay offer wake firstmate again.
The full relay object is preserved, including `in_reply_to: {author_handle, text}` when the mention is a reply in a conversation or `null` for fresh mentions.
At the same time the poll records a durable per-request reply context at `state/x-context/<request_id>.json` (`{request_id, platform, reply_max_chars, recorded_at}`) from the same authoritative relay payload, best-effort and keyed by `request_id` so concurrent requests never overwrite each other; it survives the inbox cleanup that follows the acknowledgement, so a delayed follow-up can recover the original platform and split budget even with no task link.
`recorded_at` begins as the locally observed first-seen Unix epoch and remains unchanged when the same request is polled again.
A successful live initial answer refreshes it to the time that the relay establishes the follow-up binding; dry-runs, failed answers, and follow-ups do not refresh it.
Configured polls prune records beyond the local follow-up window, capped at the relay's seven-day window; legacy or malformed records fall back to their file modification time so they cannot remain indefinitely.
The record is written only when a platform or explicit budget is actually known, so an unknown-platform mention leaves no useless entry.
The `fmx-respond` skill decides whether the stashed mention is an actionable request, a question, or a pure acknowledgment.
Actionable reversible requests are run through intake, backlog, dispatch, investigation, or ship flow as appropriate.
If the work completes in that turn, the public reply reports the outcome.
If the request spawns a longer-running task, firstmate posts an acknowledgement through the normal answer endpoint, links the task to the mention with `bin/fm-x-link.sh`, and posts up to three completion follow-ups on genuine milestones, finishing with a `--final` one for ordinary X-linked work. When a typed promised-final commitment is registered, `bin/fm-public-followup.sh` owns the terminal reply and clears the legacy link after its receipt is validated.
That link stores optional reply-platform context so Discord-originated follow-ups keep Discord's larger message budget after the inbox file has been drained.
Platform/budget resolution is layered and independent of the task link: a per-axis `FMX_REPLY_PLATFORM` / `FMX_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` override (how `bin/fm-x-followup.sh` passes a recorded link's context) wins.
For either axis without an override, `bin/fm-x-lib.sh:fmx_resolve_reply_context` owns the source order: the durable per-request registry is consulted first, then the still-present inbox payload, then - for a follow-up posted live by request_id - an authoritative relay lookup via `POST /connector/request-context` (`{request_id}` in, `{platform, reply_max_chars}` back).
This is what keeps a delayed request-id follow-up on the original platform's budget even after the inbox is drained and with no task link surviving; the relay step is confined to the live follow-up path so the answer path and every dry-run stay network-free.
`bin/fm-x-link.sh` follows the same ordering when recording a fresh link's context and requires `jq`; its request-context lookup is best-effort: no token or `curl`; a non-2xx response; an unresolved response; or a relay version without that endpoint leaves the context unknown.
In that case the link is still recorded but `bin/fm-x-link.sh` prints a loud warning; and when either a follow-up's platform or explicit budget cannot be authoritatively resolved from any source, `bin/fm-x-reply.sh` refuses it (fail-safe exit 8) rather than posting with a local default - firstmate holds and retries it once both values are recoverable.
Fresh links start with `x_followups=0` and the current timestamp; when relinking the same relay request onto a successor task, pass paired `--carry-count <n> --carry-ts <epoch>` flags plus any prior `x_platform=` and `x_reply_max_chars=` as `--carry-platform <x|discord> --carry-max <n>` so the successor preserves the already-consumed follow-up count, original 7-day window, and reply split budget.
Pure acknowledgments or mentions with nothing to answer are dismissed through `bin/fm-x-dismiss.sh` before the local inbox file is cleared.
Dismiss sends `POST /connector/dismiss` with `{request_id}`, posts no text, and tells the relay to drop the request instead of re-offering it or falling back to an offline auto-reply; on success it clears that request's durable reply-context record, while the separate offer marker remains for its bounded retention so a brief relay re-offer stays silent.
Relay auth or config problems are reported once as `x-mode-error ...` until recovery.
A failed durable offer claim is likewise reported once as `x-mode-error cannot record mention offer` and remains deduplicated through quiet no-pending polls until a later offer confirms an existing valid marker or claims a new one.
Live replies are posted by `bin/fm-x-reply.sh`, which sends `POST /connector/answer` with `{request_id,text}` for one-message replies.
Add `--image <path>` to attach one local PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, or TIFF as `{media_type,data_base64}` in the relay's optional `image` object.
Completion follow-ups use `bin/fm-x-followup.sh`, which checks the local `state/<id>.meta` link and sends the same payload shape through `POST /connector/followup` by calling `bin/fm-x-reply.sh --followup`, up to three times per link within the window.
Add `--image <path>` there too when a completion follow-up should carry an image.
A successful post increments the local `x_followups=` counter and keeps the link, unless `--final` was passed or the new count reaches the cap, in which case the link is cleared instead; a failed post leaves the link and counter untouched so it can be retried.
The relay itself rejects a follow-up past its own cap or window with HTTP 409 and may include `{"error":"followup_unavailable"}` in the response body; the client surfaces any follow-up 409 as a distinguishable exit code and uses the body marker only for a sharper diagnostic.
`fm-x-followup.sh` treats that exit exactly like a locally-detected expiry - clearing the link and skipping quietly rather than retrying - so an older single-follow-up relay or an already-exhausted binding degrades gracefully.
It treats `fm-x-reply.sh`'s fail-safe refusal (exit 8: platform or explicit budget unresolved) differently: that is a retryable hold, so the link is KEPT and the follow-up is retried once both values can be recovered, never posted with a local default.
Past-window relay rejections are only guaranteed while the expired binding row still exists on the relay side; after its cleanup sweep, a very-late follow-up call may instead see a benign no-op 200, which is why the local window and cap pruning remains the primary guard.
Reply splitting is platform-aware: an explicit relay platform field (`reply_platform`, `platform`, `target_platform`, `source_platform`, or `provider`) wins, otherwise a legacy `tweet_id` beginning with `discord:` selects Discord and a numeric `tweet_id` selects X.
An explicit relay limit field (`reply_max_chars`, `reply_max_characters`, `message_max_chars`, `message_limit`, or `max_chars`) wins over the platform defaults.
If the reply exceeds the selected budget, the client splits it into a numbered thread on fenced-code, paragraph, line, and word boundaries and sends `{request_id,text,texts}`, where `texts` is the ordered chunk list and `text` remains the first chunk for older relays.
When `--image <path>` is present on a split reply, the image rides the first/opener message and later chunks stay text-only.
`FMX_X_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 280 and clamps to a minimum of 50; `FMX_DISCORD_REPLY_MAX_CHARS` defaults to 1900, clamps to a minimum of 50, and resets values above Discord's 2000-character limit back to 1900.
`FMX_X_THREAD_MAX` defaults to 25 and caps oversized reply threads for every platform, marking the last retained message with an ellipsis when truncation is needed.
`FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_AGE_SECS` defaults to 604800 (7 days) and controls the local completion follow-up window; `FMX_FOLLOWUP_MAX_COUNT` defaults to 3 and controls the local follow-up cap.

Set `FMX_DRY_RUN` to preview replies and dismissals without posting.
Truthy means anything except unset, empty, `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`; an explicit environment value wins over `.env`.
In dry-run, `fm-x-reply.sh` records the would-be payload to `state/x-outbox/<request_id>.json`, including `texts` for a thread and an `endpoint` marker for follow-up previews, prints a `DRY RUN` summary to stderr, echoes the `request_id`, and exits 0.
When an image is attached, the dry-run record uses compact `{media_type, bytes, source_path}` metadata instead of writing the base64 bytes.
In dry-run, `fm-x-dismiss.sh` records `{request_id, endpoint:"dismiss"}` to the same outbox path, prints a `DRY RUN` summary, echoes the `request_id`, and exits 0.
The live answer and follow-up bodies intentionally stay the same shape, including optional `image`; the relay distinguishes them by endpoint, and dismiss stays `{request_id}`.
These paths need `jq` to build the JSON payload, but they run before token and network checks, so they need neither `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` nor `curl`.

### Promised public replies (state/public-followup)

A relay request that spawns real work can leave firstmate owing a specific public reply in a specific thread.
That promise is a typed `kind=public-followup` obligation owned entirely by `tasks-axi public-followup`, with the full private request context staying in `state/x-context/`; firstmate keeps no parallel copy of either.
`bin/fm-public-followup.sh` is firstmate's side: it registers a commitment, reconciles typed terminal work results into it, and posts the final reply through `bin/fm-x-reply.sh --followup`.
Run `bin/fm-public-followup.sh --help` for the exact subcommands and flags.

Registration is what creates this home's private transport under `state/public-followup/` (mode 0700): `registry/` for the bounded public-safe binding of each live commitment, `events/` for typed terminal results awaiting reconciliation, `consumed/` for the accepted-event ledger, `rejected/` for refusals kept with a one-line reason, and `surfaced` for the poll's last-surfaced signature.
The home that owns the commitment also owns the outward post, because only it holds the relay consent, the request context, and the opaque thread binding.
Work routed elsewhere reports a typed terminal result with `bin/fm-public-followup-emit.sh` and never looks for the thread; that emitter refuses to write into a home with no registration for the named obligation.
A terminal event's id is derived from its identity tuple, so a duplicate report, a retry, or a replay after restart resolves to the same event and changes nothing.

Activation is the same `.env` `FMX_PAIRING_TOKEN` contract as the rest of X mode, with no second flag.
A home without that token runs one file test and stops: no `tasks-axi` call, no backlog or request-context scan, and no `state/public-followup/` directory.
Ordinary startup, polling, cleanup, and silent read-side subcommands also produce no output; commands that require an active relay report that configuration error after the same gate.
A relay-enabled home with no registered commitment stops at an O(1) directory presence check, so the empty state costs no CLI call and adds no periodic scan.
Unreconciled terminal results ride the existing 30-second relay poll rather than a new process or timer: `bin/fm-x-poll.sh` compares the pending-event signature against `surfaced` and wakes firstmate once per new result set.
The session-start digest separately prints an "Public commitments awaiting delivery" subsection from disk when, and only when, this home is relay-active and still owes a reply, so compaction and restart are non-events.
`bin/fm-teardown.sh` refuses to clean up a task while this home still owes a public reply for exactly that work, unless `--force` carries explicit discard approval.
`FM_PF_RETRY_BACKOFF_SECS` (default 900) sets the next-attempt time recorded with a retryable delivery error.
See [verification/public-followup.md](verification/public-followup.md) for the current maintainer evidence behind the restart end-to-end and the relay-disabled zero-overhead guarantee.

## Process-to-event sources (state/procevent)

A long-polling external process is registered as a *source* through its adapter, whose header and `--help` own the commands and flags.
`bin/fm-procevent.sh` owns the generic contract; `bin/fm-procevent-lavish.sh` is the first adapter and wraps only the currently published `lavish-axi poll` interface.

This section is the single owner of the runner's operating contract.
Registration writes one private record under `state/procevent/`, and a completed result plus its immutable adapter identity are captured under `state/procevent-inbox/` before it is published.
Results are published as ordinary `check` wakes carrying the source id and committed result sequence through the existing durable wake queue, so the runner adds no second notification control plane.
The watcher delivers a queued result on its ordinary cycle by reporting it as an actionable `check` wake, so a captured result reaches firstmate through the same rewake path every other wake uses and never waits for a manual drain.
Delivery is reported at most once per captured source and sequence while any records for that key remain queued.
A durable handled acknowledgement stops future re-announcement, while a record already queued remains under the durable queue's authority until the ordinary drain consumes it.

Discovery is never a timer.
Each registered source has its own child process blocking on that source, and the watcher's per-cycle `reconcile` republishes every captured result with no durable handled acknowledgement yet - regardless of any earlier publication - restarts a source whose owner is gone, and stops this home's runner when reconciliation runs after its registration disappeared unexpectedly.
In supported steady state, a home with no registered source runs nothing, generates no state, and keeps its ordinary cadence.

Whether a captured result ends its source is adapter knowledge, never the runner's.
After publishing a result the runner calls `bin/fm-procevent-<adapter>.sh terminal <result-file>` and retires the registration on exit 0 alone, dropping only the exact registration generation captured by its claim and releasing that claim only after removal succeeds under one source boundary; a missing command, an error, or any other exit keeps the source armed, so an adapter with no notion of ending needs no change.
A failed terminal removal stays durably terminal and is completed by ordinary reconciliation without restarting its poll, while a concurrently replaced registration survives and becomes independently runnable after the old claim releases.
A source that has ended therefore captures at most one terminal result, is never restarted, and leaves no recurring poll work, while explicit `retire` stays the supported and idempotent path afterwards.
For Lavish that verdict covers an ended session, a missing session, and the final feedback of a `Send & End` review, which the published poll marks with `session_ended` before it returns only empty ended sessions.

Ownership is machine-wide per canonical source, because separate homes can share one underlying source store.
Claims live under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/firstmate/procevent-claims` (override with `FM_PROCEVENT_CLAIM_ROOT`).
Each claim binds its home and runner PID to a process identity, unique claim generation, and exact registration-file generation.
Registration, acquisition, replacement, retirement, and generation-bound release are serialized at one machine-wide boundary per source.
A live identity-matched owner is never displaced, and release removes only the exact generation the caller acquired.
Retirement and orphan reconciliation signal a runner process group only while its recorded process identity still matches, or when the recorded leader is gone and only its own owned group survives.
A runner leads its own process group, so a claim counts as reclaimable only when that whole generation is gone: a crashed leader whose group still has members is not stale, and reconcile stops that surviving group and releases its generation before starting any replacement.
If identity cannot be established for a live PID, or a surviving owned group cannot be proved stopped, the operation preserves the registration and claim for safe retry rather than adding a second owner.
A live PID whose identity no longer matches is a reused PID, so it is treated as stale and its process group is never signalled.

Supported secondmate retirement preflights each target home's bounded `sweep-home` command before destructive teardown, snapshots its registrations outside the target, then runs the sweep at that home's final deletion or return boundary.
If deletion or return fails, teardown restores those registrations and reconciles them before returning the refusal.
If restoration or rearming also fails, teardown returns a distinct status and reports the retained registration backup path for manual recovery instead of hiding the retired waits.
The sweep retires local registrations and machine-wide claims physically owned by that home through the same identity-checked, generation-bound retirement path, and leaves foreign-home claims untouched.
Teardown refuses with the home, lease, routing evidence, registrations, claims, and runners retained when identity is uncertain, ownership is unreadable or unreleased, or relevant state exists without a sweep-capable child script.
Raw manual deletion of a Firstmate home is unsupported because it can orphan a blocking child.
To recover, restore that home's tracked `bin/fm-procevent.sh`, run `FM_HOME=<home> <home>/bin/fm-procevent.sh sweep-home`, then rerun the supported teardown.

`FM_PROCEVENT_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` (default 1048576) bounds a single captured result while the source runs; oversized output is drained but truncated with a stderr notice rather than staged or published whole or dropped.

The runner proves exactly one durability boundary: output that reached the runner is stored at mode `0600` before any event referencing it is published, and a captured result with no durable handled acknowledgement remains eligible for bounded re-announcement across any number of drains and restarts, not only the crash window right after capture.
`bin/fm-procevent.sh handled <source-id> <sequence>` is the only thing that stops re-announcement: a generation-keyed, private, path-safe, durable, and idempotent acknowledgement that atomically checks and deduplicates by the exact source and sequence, so a paired effect gated on its first-time-vs-repeat report is never authorized twice.
Wake publication itself is still best-effort, so the same source and sequence can repeat even before any restart; handlers deduplicate that identity rather than assuming a wake is unique.
The runner proves nothing about the source side, and the handled acknowledgement proves nothing about a paired external effect performed before it: a crash between that effect and the acknowledgement call can still repeat the effect on replay, so this is never a generic exactly-once guarantee.
The published `lavish-axi poll` clears feedback destructively before returning it, so a result lost between that clearing and the runner reading process output is unrecoverable.
Never describe this path as at-least-once, no-loss, or lossless.
`docs/verification/process-event-sources.md` holds the measurements and `.agents/skills/process-event-sources/SKILL.md` owns the handling procedure.

```

`fm-teardown.sh` retries only Git's `Unable to create '...index.lock': File exists` return failure up to `FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` times.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRIES` accepts a nonnegative integer, and an unset, blank, or invalid value uses the default of 3.
`FM_TREEHOUSE_RETURN_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` accepts nonnegative whole or fractional seconds between attempts.
When it is unset or blank, `FM_STALE_WORKTREE_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` remains a compatible fallback, and a blank fallback uses the 1-second default.
An invalid nonblank wait falls back to 1 second rather than interrupting teardown.
Teardown never removes a lock during the retry window, and after that window it attempts stale-lock cleanup only for a still-present lock that passes the configured age and live-holder checks.

`fm-fleet-sync.sh` applies the same shape to an orphaned `.git/packed-refs.lock`: it retries only Git's `Unable to create '...packed-refs.lock': File exists` fetch failure up to `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRIES` times (nonnegative integer; unset, blank, or invalid uses the default of 3), waiting `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_RETRY_WAIT_SECS` seconds (nonnegative whole or fractional; invalid falls back to 1 second) before each.
Only after those retries exhaust does it remove the lock, and only when it is provably stale - still present, mtime age at least `FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_AGE_SECS` (default 30), and no `lsof` holder of the lock file or of the clone worktree itself (a live `git` keeps that as its cwd even in the window after it closes the lock and before it exits).
A live lock, a missing `lsof`, any failed check, or any other fetch failure keeps today's behavior.
Every wait, retry, and removal is printed to stderr, and a successful recovery also prints one `recovered:` summary line to stdout so a session-start refresh - which discards fleet-sync stderr and relays only stdout - still surfaces it.
The shared staleness proof lives in `bin/fm-lock-lib.sh`, which both `fm-teardown.sh` and `fm-fleet-sync.sh` use.
